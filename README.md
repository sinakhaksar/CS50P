# Harvard CS50P Problem Sets (2022)

Welcome to my repository for the problem sets from Harvard's CS50P course (2022), taught by Professor David Malan. This repository contains solutions for the assignments completed in this course, which focuses on Python programming and problem-solving.

## About CS50P

CS50P is Harvard's introduction to programming with Python. The course covers fundamental concepts, data structures, and algorithms, aiming to enhance programming skills through hands-on problem sets.

## Purpose

This repository showcases my work from the course. I'm using these problem sets to improve my Python skills and will continue to commit more solutions as I progress through the course.

## Usage

Feel free to explore, use, or adapt the code here. For any questions, contact me at [your-email@example.com].
