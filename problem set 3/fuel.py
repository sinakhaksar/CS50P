How to Test
Hereâ€™s how to test your code manually:

Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 3/4 and press Enter. Your program should output:
75% 
Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 1/4 and press Enter. Your program should output:
25%
Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 4/4 and press Enter. Your program should output:
F
Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 0/4 and press Enter. Your program should output:
E
Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 4/0 and press Enter. Your program should handle a ZeroDivisionError and prompt the user again.
Run your program with python fuel.py. Type three/four and press Enter. Your program should handle a ValueError and prompt the user again.
Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 1.5/3 and press Enter. Your program should handle a ValueError and prompt the user again.
Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 5/4 and press Enter. Your program should prompt the user again.
