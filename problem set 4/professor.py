How to Test
Hereâ€™s how to test your code manually:

Run your program with python professor.py. Type -1 and press Enter. Your program should reprompt you:
Level:   
Run your program with python professor.py. Type 4 and press Enter. Your program should reprompt you:
Level:   
Run your program with python professor.py. Type 1 and press Enter. Your program should begin posing addition problems with positive, single-digit integers. For example:
6 + 6 =    
Your program should output 10 distinct problems before printing the number of questions you answered correctly and exiting.

Run your program with python professor.py. Type 1 and press Enter. Answer the first question incorrectly. Your program should output:
EEE
before reprompting you with the same question.

Run your program with python professor.py. Type 1 and press Enter. Answer the first question incorrectly, three times. Your program should output the correct answer. For example:
6 + 6 = 12
and then move on to another question. Answer the remaining questions correctly. Your program should output a score of 9.

Run your program with python professor.py. Type 1 and press Enter. Answer all 10 questions correctly. Your program should output a score of 10.
