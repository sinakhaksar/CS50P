How to Test
Hereâ€™s how to test your code manually:

Run your program with python bitcoin.py. Your program should use sys.exit to exit with an error message:
Missing command-line argument   
Run your program with python bitcoin.py cat. Your program should use sys.exit to exit with an error message:
Command-line argument is not a number
Run your program with python bitcoin.py 1. Your program should output the price of a single Bitcoin to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.
Run your program with python bitcoin.py 2. Your program should output the price of two Bitcoin to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.
Run your program with python bitcoin.py 2.5. Your program should output the price of 2.5 Bitcoin to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.
